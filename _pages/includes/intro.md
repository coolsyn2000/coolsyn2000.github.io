I am a Ph.D. student at **[Fei Xia Research Lab](https://www.xia-lab.com/) @ UC, Irvine**, with research interests in **Computational Imaging**, particularly in imaging through scattering media and signal process. I have earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), respectively. I have previously interned and worked full-time at **OPPO** and **VIVO** as Machine Learning Engineer, where I was responsible for developing **AI denoising models for smartphones.**
